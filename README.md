# EKA Healthcare Auth Proxy - Next.js

repo to be used when initializing eka care's SDK on FE directly
obtain your client ID, client secret and API key. Click on the `deploy` button below. this makes a repo in your GH account by cloning our repo, initializes a vercel project and connects the project with the cloned repo. And now when initializing the SDK on a FE client side app you can use the domain (that vercel assigns upon successful deployment) and leverage the pre made API route. (more on that, link)
